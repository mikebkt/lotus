# CBS (Carlos's Buffer Serializer)

This is a simple module to re-use two small functions I have copied and pasted
many times.

## serialize(buffers)

Take an array of buffers and serialize them into a single Buffer, using 32 bit
unsigned length ints.

## unserialize(buf)

Take the output of `serialize` and return the original buffers as an Array.
